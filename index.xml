      <guid>https://majdarbash.github.io/ml-neural-networks/neural-networks-overview/</guid>
      <description>Why do we use neural networks? Neural networks help us solve a lot of complicated problems when there&amp;rsquo;s no clear way to solve it. Sometimes problems can be complicated enough where we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to solve it, or solving them in conventional way will lead to very complicated algorithms which cannot adapt to changes.
Neural networks play essential role in acting like human brain - helping us solving problems which we are good at: speech recognition, object recognition, pattern recognition, classification, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Public an private keys are large integer numbers and they are represented using a separate Wallet Import Format (WIF), consisting of letters and numbers.

Private key is used to generate a signature for each blockchain transaction a user sends out. It is used to confirm that the transaction has come from the user and also prevents the transaction from being altered by anyone once it has been issued.
You sign the cryptocurrencies you send to others using a private key.</description>

      <description>There are 3 types of learning
 Supervised learning Reinforcement learning Unsupervised learning  Supervised Learning In supervised learning we try to predict an output when given an input vector. Input and target are clear in supervised learning.
Regression - target ouptut is a real numbers or a vector of real numbers
Classification - target output is a class label
Model-class is a function:
\begin{equation} y = f(x; W) \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Variables x = 10 This statement will create a variable called x which will store a number 10. By assigned value python understands that this variable will store numeric data. We can also store other data types, by assigning different types of values:
x_int = 1 x_float = 1.23 x_bool = True Note that booleans should have an uppercase in the beginning. (True and not true, False and not false)</description>

      <description>Python provides you with a great variety of built-in functions and modules. We wil display a bit of interesting examples here, using some built-in functions.
def biggest_number(*args): return max(*args) As you noticed, we can pass multiple inputs to our function using *args syntax.
# output: 6 print max(4,2,6) # output: 3 print min(3,6,7) # output: 98 print abs(-98) Determining the type of variabel and using it: # output: displays the types of variables: int, str, float x_int = 52 x_string = &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; x_float = 2.</description>

      <description>Building a completely AngularJS based frontend can be really fun. Frontend developers enjoy having complete control of the routing, views, reusability of components and&amp;nbsp;testing the frontend as a stand-alone entity. At the same time, backend developers provide the frontend app with APIs and effectively invest the time into building reliable and cleaner API structures with having a clear separation of frontend and backend.
However a lot of SEO specialists are still arguing about the impact of SEO with AngularJS.</description>

      <description>[latexpage]
In perceptron model weights are changed to get a better set of weights. In multi-layer neural network this algorithm won&#39;t work and we don&#39;t use&amp;nbsp;perceptron learning algorithm.
For multi-layer nets the objective is the&amp;nbsp;actual&amp;nbsp;outputs values reaching target output values.
Linear Neurons The neuron has a real-valued output which is weighted sum of its inputs:
\begin{equation} &amp;nbsp;y = \sum_{i}{x_i w_i} = W^T X &amp;nbsp;\end{equation}
$W$ - Weight vector

      <title>React Native: Building the &#34;Shoes&#34; App</title>
      <link>https://majdarbash.github.io/2016/10/20/react-native-the-shoe-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 10:18:13 +0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://majdarbash.github.io/2016/10/20/react-native-the-shoe-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently experimenting building a react native app. After&amp;nbsp;digging a bit deeper into hybrid development, I have got attracted to the concept of producing a native code, in contrast to the web view approach in most of hybrid apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got. Setting it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html&#34;&gt;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;you&#39;ll get some instructions how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Install JDK&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Install Android SDK&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Adding android SDK path to the ~/.bashrc
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/opt/android-sdk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JDK can be installed using this link:&lt;br /&gt;
 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android SDK can be installed using:&lt;br /&gt;
 brew install android-sdk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing these 3 steps, we would need to install some android packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Android package manager:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;android&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These packages will be required to run the android simulator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Android SDK Build-tools version 23.0.1&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Android 6.0 (API 23)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Android Support Repository&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Intel x86 Atom System Image (for Android 5.1.1 - API 22)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would also require to download IntelHAXM.dmg file, which you can do from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the installation file after download dmg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Install IntelHAXM.dmg
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.dmg&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;sdk&gt; is&amp;nbsp;/usr/local/opt/android-sdk on OS X&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;To check that configuration is done correctly
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;kextstat | grep intel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;You should see message
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;com.intel.kext.intelhaxm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we would like to create an android virtual device (AVD):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# launching avd manager
android avd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &#34;Create&#34; and choose the following options for your AVD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://majdarbash.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-10-18-at-11.13.16-PM-e1476818078568.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-418 size-large aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://majdarbash.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-10-18-at-11.13.16-PM-1024x767.png&#34; alt=&#34;screen-shot-2016-10-18-at-11-13-16-pm&#34; width=&#34;648&#34; height=&#34;485&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your AVD is created and you can start your emulator using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;emulator -avd &lt;avd name&gt;
# in our example: emulator -avd reactnative&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iOS installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS emulator will be installed automatically as part of Xcode installation. You can install Xcode from the the app store and choose the particular emulator to start from within Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding let&#39;s make sure that we have the following tools in place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;brew&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;android&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;node&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;watchman (brew install watchman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://majdarbash.github.io/digging-react-native/&#34;&gt;installation post&lt;/a&gt; for more information about&amp;nbsp;how to install these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# install the react native cli
npm install -g react-native-cli&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this script to create your first app (our app is called &#34;Shoes&#34;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;react-native init Shoes&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any point throughout this tutorial, you can run your app using these commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# run your app on iOS
react-native run-ios
&lt;h1 id=&#34;run-your-app-on-android&#34;&gt;run your app on Android&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;react-native run-android&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time for fun now, let&#39;s start coding to build our beautiful shoe app !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &#34;Shoes&#34; App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is in place now, time to start the work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s navigate to the directory where we initialized the shoe app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;cd Shoes
&lt;h1 id=&#34;directory--listing&#34;&gt;directory  listing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ls -F&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://majdarbash.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.13.29-PM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-439 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://majdarbash.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.13.29-PM-1024x781.png&#34; alt=&#34;screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-10-13-29-pm&#34; width=&#34;648&#34; height=&#34;494&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have got several files here. T0 give possibility to distinguish the code based on the version used, we have 2 entry scripts: index.ios.js and index.android.js which will be parsed and executed based on the corresponding app platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>1.2.1 - Introduction We have a set of teachers who needs a schedule for a set of subjects over a set of periods, this schedule must take into account characteristics of periods of week, the limited availability of teacher and rooms, and some constraints which should be fulfilled.
The problem of assigning teachers to subjects and groups for timetabling problem has been studied by many authors. Tillet (1975) was the first to address it, using an integer linear programming model.</description>

      <description>1.3.1 - Operation Specification The program should be executed as follows:
Data entries for the program should be supplied within the tables in the “genalgo.accdb” database file. These tables contain the teacher definitions, teacher available times, subjects, teacher subjects mapping, rooms and corresponding room types. From all these tables in the preprocessing stage, the groups and then the cells tables are created, which will be used then as an input to our program.</description>

      <description>We are proud to see amazing results for the timetabling problem. As stated in the section before, that the maximum time for satisfying essential hard constraints was 15 minutes. This time is good enough, but in worse cases, the performance will be worse of course. This is why we introduce a new area for improvement in future – we would consider that it may be really efficient if we define and implement new heuristics within the HeuristicSwitcher, which might help us a lot in finding solution faster.</description>

Does this error look familiar?
What is happening is that docker client is communicating with the engine using socket file. As docker service is launched using root user and socket file is accessible to every user in &amp;ldquo;docker&amp;rdquo; group, you will not be able to connect to this file from docker client executed launched with your current user access.</description>

      <title>How to measure distance between strings? What is Levenstein Distance?</title>

      <guid>https://majdarbash.github.io/random/levenshtein-distance-in-mysql-measuring-distance-between-the-strings/</guid>
      <description>Levenshtein distance function can be used to measure distance between the strings. Smaller distance will mean that string 1 is closer to string 2. This function can be used to implement &amp;ldquo;fuzzy&amp;rdquo; text search in mySQL where you can search for records and order by levenshtein distance in ascending order. In this case the closest matches (more relevant results) will appear on top and then the less relevant ones.

      <description>A usual scenario encountered by every web server is administrator is to password protect specific directory and all it&amp;rsquo;s resources. We need to add some lines in the configuration file where our web server / virtual host is defined. This is how we do it:
Creating the password file: (the system will ask you to enter the password which will be saved in encrypted format)

      <description>One other way to fix CORS issue and prevent your API endpoints to be exposed is to configure Apache2 web server to proxy certain requests, thus making it serve the requests to different domain through the apache installation of the current domain. The other application I can think about would be to hide the web service endpoint.
In order to make apache act as a &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; you need to make sure that proxy_http extension is there.</description>

sudo aptitude -y install squid3
Editing the configuration file:
sudo vim /etc/squid3/squid.conf // add a line in order to enable global access: http_access allow all
Restart the squid to reflect the newly changed configuration settings
initctl restart squid3
As the squid is running now, you can access the proxy by setting the default port as 3128 and using the host ip address.</description>

      <guid>https://majdarbash.github.io/random/docker-network-conflicts/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes docker container networks created will conflict with the network configuration you have.
To fix it, I&amp;rsquo;m using the following configuration on my local machine:
# /etc/docker/daemon.json { &amp;quot;bip&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;192.168.199.1/28&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dns&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;8.8.8.8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8.8.4.4&amp;quot;] } This configuration will limit the IP addresses of the docker containers to 192.168.199.1 CIDR block. In addition you may want to troubleshoot. This may help you identify any potential conflict between your network / DNS server addresses and your existing networks / bridges created by docker.</description>

      <description>Explanation Other than uploading your wordpress sites to the new domain, you will need to do some changes in your database. Therefore, when you want to move the wordpress website to a new domain, you will find out that existing database records are still pointing at the old domain. So how do we properly migrate our wordpress site to the new domain name?
I have seen a lot of developers going straight to the database and updating records to a new domain.</description>

RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !=localhost RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]
This line is placed to make sure that redirection does not occur on your localhost during the development process. You can remove this line if you want to place the .htaccess configuration directly on your production server. Otherwise you can leave it and change &amp;ldquo;localhost&amp;rdquo; to any other local web server you are running.</description>

Basically, I was building the HTML part of the hybrid app, using cordova and phonegap. The app is accessing the web service using jquery calls: $.ajax. The issue was that in order to test the app on my google chrome browser, I had to bypass the cross domain request restriction.</description>

      <description>Introduction Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js is becoming more and more popular as NodeJS applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any operating system.
The main features of Node JS area:
Event-driven / asynchronous programming
Instead of retuning values for the functions and determining the program-flow, you basically define functions that are called by the system when an interesting event occurs (event callbacks).</description>

Of course you will need some broader sources and reference informaiton after completing the tutotrials in codeacademy. So I got this exercise from codeacademy - let&amp;rsquo;s see how we can solve it.</description>

      <description>Writing to file Following example will populate the output.txt file with the squares of numbers from 1 - 10.
my_list = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
Generates a list of squares of the numbers 1 - 10 f = open(&amp;ldquo;output.txt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo;)
for item in my_list: f.write(str(item) + &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo;)
f.close()
You have probably noticed that we are opening the file in &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; mode, i.e. for writing. We can use &amp;ldquo;r+&amp;rdquo; flag if we would like to read and write from the file.</description>

      <description>Modules make your code reusable and sharable amount different files. Module is a file that contains definitions - including variables and functions - that you can use once its imported.
Some modules are built-in and will expose you to their functions once imported. Example below shows how sqrt function becomes available once the math module is imported:
# importing math module import math print math.sqrt(25)
importing specific functions / variables frmo math module from math import sqrt print sqrt(25)</description>

      <description>Lambda functions Using lambda functions we can create functions in runtime, and use them as we go. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of lambda function and how it is used to filter the array. filter() function takes the lambda function as the first parameter, passes items of the list sequentially and filters the list to retain the items which pass the filtration function passed as first argument.
# will assign a range of numbers from 0 to 15 to numbers list numbers = range(16)</description>

and can be accessed by indices, similar to any other programming language:
# output: strawberry print fruits[2]
substitution of existing element will replace apple with kiwi in fruits list fruits[1] = &amp;ldquo;kiwi&amp;rdquo;
defining an empty list:
vegetables = []
appending items to the existing list:

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s tons of deployment tools available these days. Deploybot.com (previously known as Dploy.io) is one of the nice tools I used since a while.
Basically the tool offered as capability to configure SSH connection to statically defined instances, perform code upload, apply configuration, run before and after install scripts and trigger other deployments. In addition they provide what they call &amp;ldquo;Atomic&amp;rdquo; deployment. This assures zero downtime and code consistency throughout the deployment nodes as the document root is switched from one release to another using softlink.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get some terminology straight.
Service is an object which performs specific function - sending email, caching, etc. Service container will control how services are constructured and are used in Dependency Injection.
Based on DI practices objects will be passed, which makes the code cleaner and writing tests easier.
# Displays full list of defined services php bin/console debug:container services.yaml Contains service configuration. Here you will find paths defined to be used as services.</description>

      <description>Along with price and scalability, redundancy and fault-tolerance are possibly the most important triggers driving cloud migration. The cloud architecture should allow failure without affecting the availability of the entire system. We want to be able to test the failure scenarios.  Chaos Monkey  Randomly disables production instances Testing ability to survive the failure without overall impact on the service Leads to building automatic recovery mechanism to deal with system failures  Latency Monkey  Induces artificial delays to RESTful client-server communication layer to simulate service degradation.</description>

      <description>Is Travis CI a good CI tool? Travis CI is a very popular and widely used tool. I was personally using Travis for quite a while and had a good experience.
There are few things you should consider before starting with Travis. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to start with Travis. I cannot imagine a faster integration with a CI tool.
All you have to do in order to start is to add your github repo to travis.</description>

      <guid>https://majdarbash.github.io/random/ubuntu-server-clock-synchronisation-using-ntpd/</guid>
      <description>NTP is Network Time Protocol. This protocol is used for clock synchronisation between computer systems. NTP is one of the oldest protocols which are still used on the Internet.
The scenario below explains the use of NTP:
While the server is running, the system clock will gradually slow or run faster which will lead to clock misalignment. Whether you are running multiple systems over a load balancer, or just multiple systems in parallel, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to make sure that they are all on the same clock, interpreting and processing the records with the same current time.</description>
