      <description>I have encountered this issue several times while I was trying to run my hybrid mobile app on google chrome browser. In particular, an app based on ionic framework was used. Basically, I was building the HTML part of the hybrid app, using cordova and phonegap. The app is accessing the web service using jquery calls: $.ajax. The issue was that in order to test the app on my google chrome browser, I had to bypass the cross domain request restriction.</description>

      <description>Is Travis CI a good CI tool? Travis CI is a very popular and widely used tool. I was personally using Travis for quite a while and had a good experience.
There are few things you should consider before starting with Travis. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to start with Travis. I cannot imagine a faster integration with a CI tool.
All you have to do in order to start is to add your github repo to travis.</description>
