      <description>I have encountered this issue several times while I was trying to run my hybrid mobile app on google chrome browser. In particular, an app based on ionic framework was used. Basically, I was building the HTML part of the hybrid app, using cordova and phonegap. The app is accessing the web service using jquery calls: $.ajax. The issue was that in order to test the app on my google chrome browser, I had to bypass the cross domain request restriction.</description>
