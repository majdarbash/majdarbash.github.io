Reuse existing internet connections AWS managed endpoint include multi-data center redundancy and automated failover Supports static routes and BGP peering and routing policies   Limitations  Network latency, variability and availability Customer managed endpoint for implementing redundancy and failover Customer device must support BGP if required     Redundant AWS managed VPN connections   AWS Direct Connect  Dedicated network connection over private lines Advantages  More predictable network performance, reduced bandwidth cost 1 or 10 Gbps provision connections Supports BGP peering and routing policies You can connect to VPCs in different regions using AWS Direct Connect Gateway   Disadvantages  May require additional telecom and hosting provide relationship or new network circuits to be provisioned     AWS Direct Connect Gateway   AWS Direct Connect + VPN  IPSec VPN connection over private lines Advantages  AWS Direct Connect features with the addition of secure IPSec VPN connection   Disadvantages  Additional VPN complexity added on top of AWS Direct Connect    AWS VPN CloudHub  Connect remote branch offices in hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity AWS VPN CloudHub leverages an Amazon VPC virtual private gateway with multiple gateways, each using unique BGP autonomous system numbers (ASNs) Advantages  Reuse existing internet connections and AWS VPN connections AWS managed virtual private gateway include multi-data center redundancy and automated failover Support BGP for exchanging routes and routing policies   Disadvantages  Network latency,variability and availability are dependent on the internet User managed branch office endpoints are responsible for implementing redundancy and failover    Software VPN  Software application-based VPN connection over the internet Advantages  Supports a wider array of VPN vendors, products, and protocols Fully customer-managed solution   Disadvantages  Customer is responsible for implementing HA solutions for all VPN endpoints     Software VPN   Transit VPC  Software appliance-based VPN connection with hub VPC Common strategy for connecting multiple, geographically disperse VPCs and remote networks in order to create a global network transit center AWS managed IPSec VPN connection for spoke VPC connection Advantages  Supports a wider array of VPN vendors, products, and protocols Fully customer-managed solution AWS managed VPN connection between hub and spoke VPCs   Disadvantages  Customer is responsible for implementing HA solutions for all VPN endpoints     Software VPN and Transit VPC   Amazon VPC-to-Amazon VPC Connectivity Options VPC Peering  AWS-provided network connectivity between two VPCs Advantages  Leverages AWS network infrastructure No single point of failure No bandwidth bottleneck   Disadvantages  VPC peering does nto support transitive peering relationships     VPC Peering   Software VPN  Software appliance-based VPN connections between VPCs Advantages  Leverages AWS networking equipment in-region adn internet pipes between regions Supports a wider array of VPN vendors, products and protocols Managed entirely by you   Disadvantages  You are responsible for implementing HA solutions for all VPN endpoints (if required) VPN instances could become a network bottleneck    Software-to-AWS Managed VPN  Software appliance to VPN connection between VPCs Advantages  Leverages AWS networking in-region and internet pipes between regions AWS managed endpoint includes multi-data center redundancy and automated failover   Disadvantages  You are responsible for implementing HA solutions for the software appliance VPN endpoints (if required) VPN instances could become a network bottleneck     Software to AWS Managed VPN   AWS Managed VPN  VPC-to-VPC routing managed by you over IPSec VPN connections using your equipment and the internet Advantages  Reuse existing Amazon VPC VPN connections AWS managed endpoint include multi-data center redundancy and automatic failover Supports static routes and dynamic BGP peering and routing policies   Disadvantages  Network latency, variability and availability depends on internet conditions The endpoint you manage is responsible for implementing redundancy and failover (if required)     VPC to VPC through AWS Managed VPN   AWS Direct Connect  VPC-to-VPC routing managed by you using your equipment in an AWS Direct Connect location and private lines Advantages  Consistent network performance Reduced bandwidth costs Supports static routes and BGP peering and routing policies   Disadvantages  May require additional telecom and hosting provide relationships     VPC to VPC through AWS Direct Connect   AWS Private Link (VPC endpoint)  AWS-provided network connectivity between two VPCs using interface endpoints Advantages  Leverages AWS networking infrastructure No single point of failure   Disadvantages  VPC endpoint services only available in AWS region in which they are created     AWS Private Link   Internal User-to-Amazon VPC Connectivity Options  Virtual extension of your data center into AWS Leverages existing end-user internal and remove access policies and technologies Requires existing end-user internal and remove access implementations  Software Remote-Access VPN  Cloud-based remote access solution to Amazon VPC and/or internal networks Advantages  Leverages low-cost, elastic, and secure web services provided by AWS for implementing a remote access solution   Disadvantages  Could be redundancy if internal and remote access implementations already exist     Remote Access VPN Solutions   </description>
